# Project 205: Tic-Tac-Toe

## 📖 Overview
A fully playable command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project focuses on multi-dimensional data structures and mathematical mapping to convert linear user input (1-9) into 2D grid coordinates.

## 🛠️ Concepts Learned
* **2D Arrays (`[,]`):** Creating and mutating multi-dimensional data grids.
* **Nested Loops:** Using inner and outer `for` loops to render a UI in the console.
* **The Modulo Operator (`%`):** Applying mathematical logic to map 1D inputs to 2D array indices.
* **Ternary Operators:** Writing clean, inline conditional logic for state switching.
