## 📖 About This Repository
**DotnetProjects_BasicToAdvance** is a comprehensive, hands-on journey through software engineering. This repository tracks my progress through 310 structured projects across .NET, Java, and Python. It evolves from fundamental syntax to advanced architectural patterns.

The roadmap is built on the principle of "Learning by Doing." Each project serves as a focused lab for specific technical concepts.
