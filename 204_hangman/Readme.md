# Project 204: Hangman CLI

Overview
A simplified command-line version of Hangman. This project was a major stepping stone in understanding how to store multiple pieces of data using Collections and how to iterate through them.

Concepts Learned
1. Arrays (`[]`): Creating fixed-size lists to hold character data.
2. Zero-Based Indexing: Accessing elements in an array starting from `[0]`.
3. `for` Loops: Iterating over arrays with exact start and end conditions.
4. Booleans (`bool`): Using `true/false` flags to control game states (win/loss).
